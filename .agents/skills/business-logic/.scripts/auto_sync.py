Git hook worker: auto-sync business-logic docs after git pull / push, or on a
manual trigger.

Usage:
    uv run --script auto_sync.py post-merge            # triggered after git pull
    uv run --script auto_sync.py pre-push               # triggered before git push
    uv run --script auto_sync.py manual [--base B] [--head H] [--prompt "..."]
    uv run --script auto_sync.py record --base B --head H --from manual-inline [--prompt "..."]
    uv run --script auto_sync.py state                  # print JSON: last_head / lock_busy / pending

Architecture: file-based job queue + single consumer.
Every trigger captures the EXACT commit range it introduced (post-merge:
ORIG_HEAD..HEAD; pre-push: @{u}..HEAD; manual: <last-completed-head>..HEAD) and
appends a job record to `.state/queue.jsonl`. Enqueue deduplicates at commit-hash
granularity against jobs already pending or in-flight, so the same commit is
never processed twice. Only one consumer runs at a time, enforced by an atomic
O_EXCL PID lock plus a heartbeat that keeps long syncs from looking dead. The
consumer batches all pending jobs into one range, builds a zero-LLM conversation
digest, then runs ONE claude-agent-sdk call (permission granted via the SDK
permission callback) that syncs that explicit range AND merges the digest into
the domain docs. On success it appends a completion record to
`.state/complete.jsonl` and validates the CHANGELOG was actually updated.

Single source of truth for "what has been synced" is `.state/complete.jsonl`
(the last record's head), NOT CHANGELOG.md -- CHANGELOG.md is a human-facing log
the model writes, and deriving sync state from it was brittle (stale/reformatted
hashes caused pathological over-syncs). For upgrades from older installs, the
first sync falls back to the CHANGELOG hash once, then complete.jsonl takes over.

The skill is always project-level: everything lives under
<project>/<cli>/skills/<name>/. Skill-owned directories are dot-prefixed
(.scripts, .state, .sync, .tmp) so they can never collide with a user's
business-domain directory of the same name. The engine location is derived from
__file__, so the same script serves any skill name and survives a git root that
sits above the <cli> dir.
